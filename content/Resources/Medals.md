Service medals

Service Medals, embodiments of patriotism and valor, are bestowed upon those whose unwavering initiative, boundless dedication, unyielding loyalty, inspirational leadership, or unmatched excellence stand as a testament to the highest ideals of our nation. These prestigious accolades, which honor deeds beyond the ordinary, serve as beacons of honor and recognition within our esteemed ranks.

To earn the privilege of donning a Service Medal, one must exemplify the utmost dedication and merit. A commendation from a Commanding Officer serves as the initial beacon of recognition, highlighting the exemplary conduct of a deserving candidate. This recommendation, laden with evidence and fervor, is then presented to the discerning gaze of the Captain, whose final decision holds the weight of our collective ethos.

In this intricate tapestry of valor and recognition, Commanding Officers meticulously select candidates whose deeds shine brightest amidst the fabric of service, offering compelling narratives that underscore the profound impact of their actions. Thus, each bestowed medal not only signifies individual merit but also celebrates the enduring spirit of camaraderie and patriotism that courses through the veins of our noble institution.
