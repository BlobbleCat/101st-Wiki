| Codename: CPT-08 “Gael”<br>Name:  ██████████<br>Rank: Captain<br>DOB: ██████ | “Ad Victoriam Pro Terra Aeterna”    <br>                   -CPT-08 “Gael” |

**Duties:**
Captain of the Eurasian Company, he is a tough, but strong leader. Leading his many platoons to victory no matter the adversary, from the scorching temperatures of Hellmire, dense jungles of Malevelon creek, to the freezing temperatures of Marfark. He uses real-life tactics to strategize in tough situations, saving the lives of many, Helldivers and civilians alike.



**Operational Conduct:**  
Gael is quite the team player when it comes to his fighting style, most of the time running the team's designated Anti-Tank class. Using his trusty Recoilless Rifle paired with many Eagle Strikes and Orbitals. Due to his “high impact” playstyle, he prefers using heavy armor, starring the Kodiak and Winter Warrior Armors as his main gear.   


  
**Military Career:**  
 At the start, Gael was born into a loving and caring family on Super Earth. His mother and father, named ███████ and ████████ with two younger siblings, ██████████ and █████. Him being the oldest, he was destined to be the one who watched over hisyounger siblings. His father, a high-ranking official of “Morgunson” used his high clearance level to access weaponry that many civilians could not access. This gave  Gael’s father the ability to provide firearms that were used frequently by the Helldiver Corps. Often he brought young Gael to private shooting ranges stationed at his workplace, having one-to-one sessions in teaching him how to shoot. Of course, a kid with such expertise was out of the ordinary, and so he was promoted to Sergeant in the SEAF soon after elisting and was subsequently stationed on many E-710 farms. Him being able to eradicate problematic situations of all kind so quick and effectively caught the attention of many, leading to his quick transferral to the Helldiver Corps. Gael was quite the asset, quickly stomping down and wiping out dissident cells for about 3 years. Once the Terminid scourge started to become a major threat, he was recalled from his haven and put to the frontlines to deal with bug infestations. Life as a Helldiver proved no issue for him, leading the charge at the frontlines of many bug planets, including the frigid planet of Estanu and the smokey deserts of Erata Prime. His heroic deeds didn't go unnoticed, and he was awarded many medals for his leadership and actions. Several Privates have reported seeing him “tear a bug in half while it was still alive” or him using the snowshoes on his armor to stomp Hunters and Scavengers.

**Recruitment to the 101st “Hell” Battalion:**  
After his many deployments, he eventually caught the attention of BM-01 “Mind”, who at that time was starting to develop the early roots of what later evolved into the 101st "Hell" Battalion. Given his skills, Gael was quickly recruited. Mind had observed Gael fight the Automaton menace from aboard his Super Destroyer, using his eagle-eye view to closely monitor the actions and decisions he took. Destroying the Automatons, which had wiped out many civilian settlements, did not seem to have any mental toll on Gael. He viewed his work as simply being there to finish a job, a mindset that gained Mind's favor. Gael had a “no-bullshit” approach in dealing with his objectives, and always made sure to finish every task before leaving a mission. Though Gael liked to work with the Helldiver corps, he was never able to find any real connection to the group, so he gladly left it behind to join the 101st when Mind approached him after returning from a successful mission.


**Trauma and PTSD:**
Gael's traumatic experiences are complex and interesting. Since he was the one who protected his younger siblings in school, he had to get accustomed to violence from a young age. His younger siblings were frequently discriminated against and bullied due to their heritage. This led to young Gael often having to fight and knock out someone out on the sidewalk. His early exposure to violence and his early firearm training molded him into the Captain he is today. His time fighting in the Helldiver Corps also contributed to his desensitization and buildup of trauma and PTSD. Frequent losses of fellow Helldivers and shellshock led him to lock his feelings away and becoming numb towards even the most morally debilitating losses on the battleground. Instead of grieving the loss of a subordinate, Gael channelled his pain into anger, often being seen shooting the bodies of Automatons or ripping Terminids apart after the loss of yet another Helldiver.


**Service in the 101st:**
Gael moved up the ranks side by side with Steroid while being under command of Freeze and Mind. Gael and Steroid worked quite well as a team, with both of them having a similar mentality, even after having lived through different experiences during childhood amd while working for the SEAF. Gael and Steroid spent most of their time deploying together as well as goofing around in the mess hall. His skills were unmatched in different ways, preferring to stick with the fireteam and not going solo like others. Having zero issue with ordering his subordinates around. Pushing the automaton front, and being able to use his sharp senses to hear and see patrols from extreme distances. From the thumps from hulks or the steady humms from a tank. He would be able to identify a threat when they are not even remotely near histeam. Many privates under his command have seen him look at the track of a bot patrol and accurately described each footprint, from the spacing and pattern of the track he was able to determine that there were 3 troopers, 4 devastators, 3 berserkers and 1 hulk. He has also been noted to blast off the face of a bile titan, just under 10 meters away from him, spraying the surrounding area and him with green goop from the blast of his trusty Recoilless Rifle. Gael quickly climbed the ranks, due to the massive vacancy currently available during the start of the battalion, he was raised from private to corporal quickly. Getting trained from Freeze and Mind, he rose to sergeant and quickly to the Captain. After being inactive for a bit, he was quickly put back into service and to this day, still the bold leader of the Gael/Eurasian Company.
